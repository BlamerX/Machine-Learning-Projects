# Mall Customer Segmentation

In this project I have tried to demonstrate the use of Machine Learning in businesses for profit enhancement.

Unsupervised Learning(Clustering) is used to find the hidden data patterns or structures which can be used by an organiztion(like mall, shopping complexes etc) to target the right audience and hence increase profit margin.

Also, this approach allows the organizations to spend less on advertisements by first choosing the right audience and then advertising.

### The data set is available on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)**

The features in the dataset are explained below :

1. Customer ID - It is the unique ID assigned to the customer
2. Gender - Gender of the customer
3. Age - Age of the customer(in years)
4. Annual Income(k$) - Annual income of the customer in k$
5. Spending Score - Score assigned to the customer by the mall/shopping complex based on the customer spending nature and behaviour

# Context

This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

# Content

You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

# Problem Statement

You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.
