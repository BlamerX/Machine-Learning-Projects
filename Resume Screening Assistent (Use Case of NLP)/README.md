# Why do we Need Resume Screening?

- For each recruitment, companies take out the resume, referrals and go through them manually.
- Companies often received thousands of resumes for every job posting.
- When companies collect resumes then they categorize those resumes according to their requirements and then they send the collected resumes to the Hiring Team's.
- It becomes very difficult for the hiring teams to read the resume and select the resume according to the requirement, there is no problem if there are one or two resumes but it is very difficult to go through 1000’s resumes and select the best one.
- To solve this problem, we will screen the resume using machine learning and Nlp using Python so that we can complete days of work in few minutes.

# Functionality of Application

Screening resumes usually involves a three-step process based on the role’s minimum and preferred qualifications. Both types of qualifications should be related to on-the- job performance and are ideally captured in the job description.

## These qualifications can include:

- Work experience
- Education
- Skills and knowledge
- Personality traits
- Competencies

# Tools & Technologies used

Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, along with text mining and natural language processing algorithms, can be applied for the development of programs (i.e. Applicant Tracking Systems) capable of screening objectively thousands of resumes in few minutes without bias to identify the best fit for a job opening based on thresholds, specific criteria or scores.
