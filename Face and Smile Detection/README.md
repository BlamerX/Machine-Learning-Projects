# Face and Smile Detector

**This project contains the following:**

***Note :*** *If you are a Beginner then do the following*

1. Go to the command prompt and run the following command



```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

This allows you to run the opencv python liberary that helps us to do Computer Vision / deep Learning.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BlamerX/Face-and-Smile-Detector.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Run the project

  python python-file.py
```




## How to Start

To get Started run the files in order of the following as this order is from easy to difficulty

1. We start with a image and we try to use our model so that it takes a image as input an using the haar cascade files at 
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

These are some pretrained model that helps us to get started in the early stages so that we can get a boost.

**Order in which we will run the files is :**

 - [face_Detector.py](https://github.com/BlamerX/Face-and-Smile-Detector/blob/main/face_Detector.py)
 - [video_face_detection.py](https://github.com/BlamerX/Face-and-Smile-Detector/blob/main/face_Detector.py)
 - [smile_detection.py](https://github.com/BlamerX/Face-and-Smile-Detector/blob/main/smile_detection.py)
 - [eyes_detection.py](https://github.com/BlamerX/Face-and-Smile-Detector/blob/main/eyes_detection.py)
